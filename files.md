| close()                    |               Closes an opened file. It has no effect if the file is already closed.               |
| detach()                   |             Separates the underlying binary buffer from the TextIOBase and returns it.             |
| fileno()                   |                      Returns an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.                      |
| flush()                    |                            Flushes the write buffer of the file stream.                            |
| isatty()                   |                          Returns True if the file stream is interactive.                           |
| read(n)                    |    Reads at most n characters from the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or None.     |
| readable()                 |                         Returns True if the file stream can be read from.                          |
| readline(n=-1)             |          Reads and returns one line from the file. Reads in at most n bytes if specified.          |
| readlines(n=-1)            | Reads and returns a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most n bytes/characters if specified. |
| seek(offset,from=SEEK_SET) |       Changes the file position to offset bytes, in reference to from (start, current, end).       |
| seekable()                 |                      Returns True if the file stream supports random access.                       |
| tell()                     |           Returns an integer that represents the current position of the file's object.            |
| truncate(size=None)        |   Resizes the file stream to size bytes. If size is not specified, resizes to current location.    |
| writable()                 |                         Returns True if the file stream can be written to.                         |
| write(s)                   |           Writes the string s to the file and returns the number of characters written.            |
| writelines(lines)          |                                Writes a list of lines to the file.                                 |
